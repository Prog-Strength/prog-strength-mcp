"""Per-request correlation id, mirroring the Go API's `internal/requestid`.

Every inbound HTTP request gets a `request_id`: a 32-char hex string
(`secrets.token_hex(16)` — the same shape as the API's `internal/id.New`,
which is `crypto/rand` 16 bytes hex-encoded, NOT a dashed uuid4). The id
is minted by `RequestIDMiddleware` unless the caller already sent an
`X-Request-ID` header, in which case that value is honored so a single
trace can span the frontend → agent → MCP → API hops.

The id is:
  - echoed back on the `X-Request-ID` response header of every request,
  - stored in a ContextVar so any code on the request's task can read it
    via `current_request_id()` (the /health body, error envelopes) without
    threading it through every call signature,
  - stamped onto every `prog_strength_mcp` log record by
    `RequestIDLogFilter` so a request can be reverse-searched in logs.

This is a pure-ASGI middleware (not Starlette's BaseHTTPMiddleware) on
purpose: BaseHTTPMiddleware runs the route handler in a separate task,
so a ContextVar set in its `dispatch` would not be visible downstream.
A pure-ASGI middleware sets the var in the same task the rest of the app
runs in, so the value propagates everywhere.
